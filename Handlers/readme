its one of  importend topic in ansible

we get lot question in interview from this topic
what are handlers ?
it execute task only if another taks completes successfully.

ok then how handler will work, there is something called "notify" 
that "notify" used to trig the main task.


we can use handler when 
-  restart services
-  hosts reboots

more


and  NOTE: Handlers are executed after all tasks execution complited


for example something went wrong in task (failed ), handler wont do anything

even if  tasks failed, we want handler to be exected 
we can use " 

force handler : true

 " this will execute handler even tasks file.



NOte: one the interview questio 
     one task -----------------> tricker----------------> more then one handler
    


in industry no one use multiple handler.
